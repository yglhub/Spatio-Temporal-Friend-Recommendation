\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we study the predictive power of historical check-ins in predicting a user's future check-in time to a given location. Using historical location data to model human mobility pattern is a long-standing research topic. To our best knowledge, although check-in location prediction has been intensively studied, making prediction in the time-dimension remains an open issue.  The scarcity of check-in data makes it challenging to accurately model the check-in time of a location. To address this problem, we propose a comprehensive framework that can learn model using both historical visitors and potential visitors to the location. Here, potential visitor is defined as a user who has not reported a check-in to the location before, but is likely to do so in the future. Standard regression models cannot use potential visitors. We circumvent this problem by first formulating our problem as a censored regression problem, and then propose a modified Cox-regression method which can take advantage of potential visitors. In our experiments, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance comparing with standard regression techniques with uses only historical visitor data. Moreover, our method is capable of predicting the time of several forms of complex check-in events.
