\subsection{Problem Statement} \label{sec:problem}


In this paper, we assume the precise check-ins, instead of geographic coordinates is given, as in the Foursquare dataset. Nevertheless, the proposed method is also applicable to coordinates...


We formally define the notion of \textit{Check-in} and \textit{User Trajectory} used in this paper.




We define a \textit{Co-visitation} of two users as follows: 



We formulate the social connection prediction problem as a classification problem, where the goal is to assign a given pair of users into one of the two classes: \textit{Friends} and \textit{Non-friends}.


\subsection{Methodology} \label{sec:framework}

What model to use?? DNN? Linear? 
Use feature selection to select only significant locations/time slots? AdaBoost?
Matrix Factorization? for full paper...

Given the trajectories of two users $u_i$ and $u_j$, we propose a three step method...

1. Feature extraction
2. Model learning
3. Prediction



Hypothesis (For a full paper), Research questions
1. Active user vs Non-active users?
2. Percentage of friends can be explained? 
3. Most significant types of locations?
4. Most significant time slots?
5. Geo-distance and predictive power?
